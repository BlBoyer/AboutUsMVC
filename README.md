Introduction:  
  
This app was made to prove and practice my skills with asp.net mvc projects. It allows users to create a public profile with some basic 'about me'-type information.  
  
Site layout:  
  
Home page  
  -Login - allows a user to log-in.  
  -Lookup - allows a search to be made on a the user database.  
  -Manage profiles - allows an admin to moderate user content.  
User page  
  -Displays user profile and content.  
Lookup  
  -Allows search to be performed by username, displays user page with the same view the user gets, but without the ability to edit information.  
  
Usage:  
  -To create an account: use the button on the homepage- enter your details.  
  -Once finished, wait until redirected to your personal page, otherwise errors may occur.  
  -You can edit content by using edit icons on the page.  
  -To delete an account the password must be given to someone with administrator access of the app.  
  -To manage accounts, you must login with the correct password. From this page accounts may be edited or deleted.  
  
Functionality:  
  -When a new user is created, the username and password are used to create a unique key that is used to authenticate a user.  
  -On successful login, the user is granted authorization by ip and account info.
  
Special Notes:  
  -Special care should be taken when creating accounts as to wait for all processes to complete and not close the browser during actions.  
  -To delete an account the account password is required, therefore, the password must be given to someone with administrator access in order to complete.
